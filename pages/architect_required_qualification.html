                <p>
                    The basic degree essential for becoming an architect is the Bachelor
                    of Architecture (B. Arch). All B. Arch programs are professional
                    degrees with accreditation from the National Architectural
                    Accrediting Board (NAAB).

                    2 years of design experience done minimum works in 30 house as a
                    interior designer Most states require architects to renew their
                    licenses by submitting proof of continuing education credits in
                    architectural or professional subjects. Topics for courses that
                    architects may take to renew their license include sustainability,
                    accessibility and safety. This ensures architects remain vigilant
                    about their skills and continue to commit to creating safe buildings
                    and other structures for people to use and enjoy.
